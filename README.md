useEffect Hook is often used to retriev some data.
to be able to do this we will need to set up a mock up api within our project
so we are going to use JSON server fo this "npm i json-server"

in the root directory of our project we are going to create a mock database file. "db.json"
then create a schema

then run our mock api using "json-server --watch db.json --port 3001"


These basically covers 
# React Components
# React Props
# React Hooks (basic)
# Event Handling
# Data fetching (basic)
