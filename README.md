then create a schema

then run our mock api using "json-server --watch db.json --port 3001"

# React Props
# React Hooks (basic)
# Event Handling
# Data fetching (basic)


# UseState is a react hook that "creates state variable" that helps us to track state in components and updates the user interface.

**** Fetching data from APIs
**** Setting timers
**** Handling local storage
**** Handling browser events
**** Handling DOM mutations
**** Handling server-side rendering

# useRef Hook is used to create mutable variables, which will not re-render the component. also use for accessing DOM elements

# useMemo Hook returns a memoized value, Its like catching a value so that it doesnt need to be calculated. 
**** useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies gets updated (this can inprove the performance of the application)

# useReducer Hook is used to handle complex state changes, it is similar to useState but it is
